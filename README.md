# Web-yt-dlp
This is a locally hosted website that allows you to download youtube videos using yt dlp.

This project is simply a fancy web ui, with a lot of AJAX and PHP running in the back, with of course yt-dlp downloading the videos.

This is meant to be used with docker, but it can be used in other applications as well.
There is a $dir variable in index.php and fileHandler.php that will let you change the desired download laction.
